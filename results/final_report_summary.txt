FINAL MODEL REPORT 

Best Model: XGBoost_tuned

Log-space performance:
- RMSE (log): 1.3654
- MAE (log): 0.4712
- R² (log): 0.3835

Real-price performance:
- RMSE (price): 8471868.23
- MAE (price): 3898674.94
- MAPE: inf% 

Interpretation:
The MAE indicates that, on average, the model is off by ≈ 3898675 units of price.

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT MAPE:
The MAPE value appears as 'inf%' because some properties in the dataset 
have actual_price = 0. Since MAPE divides by the true value, division by zero 
makes the metric undefined. For this reason, MAPE is not suitable for this dataset.
Instead, RMSE, MAE, and R² (especially in log-space) provide the correct evaluation.
